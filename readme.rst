Integrity
=========

To test the integrity of a Numerai dataset::

    $ python integrity/run.py -d numerai_dataset_20171004.zip
    INTEGRITY
      /data/ni/numerai_dataset_20171004.zip
    IDS
    ERAS
    REGIONS
    FEATURES
      range of feature 46 in eraX   [ 0.0000,  1.0060] not in [0, 1]
    LABELS
    PREDICTIONS
    DONE
      integrity check in 55 second

On 2017-10-04 two Numerai datasets were released. Let's run the integrity
check on the dataset that had problems::

    $ python integrity/run.py -d numerai_dataset_20171004_problems.zip

You can optionally write to a logfile and a warnfile by appending
``-l logfile.txt`` and ``-w warnfile.txt`` to the command above.

There is also a Data object which can be used like this::

    $ ipython
    In [1]: from integrity.data import Data
    In [2]: data = Data('numerai_dataset_20171004.zip')
    In [3]: data
    Out[3]:
    /data/ni/numerai_dataset_20171004.zip
     884553  rows
         50  features
         98  eras
          0  duplicate IDs
     0.5000  mean label
     0.0000  min feature
     0.4993  mean feature
     1.0060  max feature
     0.1172  std feature
     0.0000  min abs corr
     0.2030  mean abs corr
     0.7413  max abs corr
